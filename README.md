# Video-game-Space_Invaders2998.

#Description: This is a simple video game that I created using Python and the Turtle module.
The game is called Space Invaders2998. The player is a blue triangle and the enemies are red circles.

- [ The player can move left and right using the left and right arrow keys. The player can shoot bullets]
- [Using the space bar. The enemies move down the screen and the player must shoot them before they reach]
- [The bottom of the screen. The player's score is displayed in the top left corner of the screen. The game]
- [Ends when the player's score reaches 100 or when the player is hit by an enemy.]
- [That is the idea of the game and just have a few problems with the code]
- [the first problem is that the enemies are not moving down the screen]
- [the second problem is that the bullets are not shooting]
- [the third problem is that the game is not ending when the player's score reaches 100 or when the player is hit by an enemy]
- [Somoone please help me with this code and contribute to it. thank you]
